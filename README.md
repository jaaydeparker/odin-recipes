<h1>Project I: Recipes</h1>
A HTML/CSS website dedicated to recipes. This is a project designated by the Foundations course of The Odin Project. 
<h2>Pre-Project Review</h2>
The goal of this project is to practise designing a webpage with basic HTML and CSS. 

<h2>Post-Project Review</h2>
<strong>What went well?</strong>
<ul>
  <li>I was happy to learn about and utilize the auto-generated HTML hotplate. This made everything a lot easier, rather than typing out the same generic information several times.</li>
  <li>All of the HTML and most of the CSS was familiar, and the HTML portion took less than 30 minutes to complete.</li>
  <li>There was very little I had to Google. A lot felt intuitive.</li>
 </ul>
 <br>
 <strong>What did I struggle with, and how can I learn from them?</strong>
 <ul>
  <li>I was no longer familiar with CSS classes and IDs, and utilising them was a tiny bit difficult. On the other hand, reorganising the code was informative and helpful.</li>
  <li>I felt limited and uncreative in my design. I feel that with more information on divs and flexboxes, that will subside.</li>
